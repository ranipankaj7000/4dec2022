While he was later acquitted by a CBI court and the Supreme Court in 1998, he had spent a total of 50 days in jail along with fellow scientist D Sasikumar and four others. In 2018, he was compensated Rs. 50 lakh by the Supreme Court for “unnecessary arrest, harassment and mental cruelty”.In 2020, the Kerala government had also handed over an additional compensation of ₹1.30 crore to the former scientist in the case, which has also been at the centre of several political standoffs. In the same year, in June, the CBI had booked former Intelligence Bureau (IB) deputy director RB Sreekumar and 16 other police personnel over the alleged conspiracy. Former Kerala Police officer S Vijayan - among over a dozen accused - had filed a plea last year in the Kerala HC in the case. In his plea before the high court in July 2021, the former police officer alleged that Narayanan had influenced the CBI probe by entering into land deals worth crores with the then investigating officials of the agency. Months later, in November, the high court had dismissed the petition.</p>
